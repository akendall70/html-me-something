                <h2>Number 10: Raspberries</h2>
		<img src="images/raspberries.jpg" alt="These are some dumb, squishy fruit." width="612px">
                <p id="berry">
                    The worst of the red fruits in my opinion. They're the lazy, squishy cousin to the blackberry. They just straight up mush when you try and grab one. The raspberry does go well with cakes and desserts so you have to give
                    it that.

                <h2>Number 9: Tomatoes</h2>
		<img src="images/tomatoes.jpeg" alt ="Tomatoes in their natural habitat." width="612px">
                <p>
                    Why rank tomatoes so low you say? They are used in basically every sauce, condiment, italian dish, and salad. So why are they number 9? Because these red and round disasters do not know if they want to be a fruit or a
                    vegetable. They're living the highlife on both sides with none of the consiquences. Also they are gross just by themselves.

                <h2>Number 8: Radishes</h2>
		<img src="images/radish.jpg" alt ="Slice these babies up and put them on some tacos." width="612px">
                <p>
                    I actually really do like radishes and think they are a fantastic vegetable. You can roast them, mandoline them for thinly sliced toppings for taco night, or chop them up for a salad. They get a lower ranking as they are
                    truly red and they are just too small to make it worth your while at times.

                <h2>Number 7: Red Chili Peppers</h2>
		<img src="images/red-hot-chili-peppers.jpg" alt ="The band and the peppers are basically the same thing." width="612px">
                <p id="californication">
                    The only fruit or veg up here that a world class band is named after. "Hey", chili peppers 'spice' up any boring dish and add that kick that "Can't Stop" you from just wanting to "Dance, Dance, Dance". Also spicy food is
                    best food.

                <h2>Number 6: Red Onions</h2>
		<img src="images/Red-Onion.jpg" alt ="Serving up delicious tears." width="612px">
                <p>
                    Who doesn't love a good onion? As a staple of the holy duo of base ingredients, (the other being garlic), the onion is a cannot live with out food substance. There are an infinite number of possibilites with an onion and
		    best of all you can eat them raw. They are also like ogres.

                <h2>Number 5: Red Apples</h2>
		<img src="images/red apples.jpg" alt ="PIE TIME!" width="612px">
                <p>
                    I mean it is just a regular old fruit that everyone has around their kitchen. The apple is the pillar of the pie, the king of caramel, the sultan of salads, the top talent of turnovers, the secretary of sauce, and the 
		    list goes on and on. Basically, you can use apples as a base for most everything you make in the kitchen.

                <h2>Number 4: Rambutan</h2>
		<img src="images/rambutan.jpg" alt ="Spike balls of deliciousness." width="612px">
                <p>
		    Hailing from Vietnam, this spikey fruit delivers a delicious pear-like texture and taste that makes it worth the effort in securing this East Asian fruit.

                <h2>Number 3: Red Cherries</h2>
		<img src="images/red cherries.jpg" alt ="I want cherry pie." width="612px">
                <p>
                    Coming up third on our list, the red cherry, sometimes mistaken as a maraschino cherry, is perfect for that cocktail at home, with no one around since we are stuck inside during this pandemic but hey, home drinking is the 
		    night on the town. Or at least that is what I tell myself.

                <h2>Number 2: Strawberries</h2>
		<img src="images/strawberries.jpg" alt ="They have a great leaf hat." width="612px">
                <p id="berry">
                    Almost making it to the top of the list are the seeded berries themselves, strawberries. These are amazing to have in a smoothie, with chocolate, honey, whipped cream, cake, more cake, possibly ANOTHER cake. Either way
		    You cannot go wrong with some strawberries in your life.
                </p>

                <h2>Number 1: Watermelon</h2>
		<img src="images/watermelon.jpg" alt ="Oh you know it's summer time." width="612px">
                <p>
                    What is more summer, more quintessentially childhood around the pool and around the family than watermelon. This perfect fruit is fantastic on its own or in salads, grilled, roasted, and toasted. But really we all know
                    you are going to eat it with a big grin on your face as you dive into that watermelon wedge.
